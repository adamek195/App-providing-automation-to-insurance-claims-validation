# Web-based app providing automation to insurance claims validation

The project and the prototype of a web-based app providing automation to insurance claims validation. The application allows you to handle information about ongoing car insurance. The user can add new policies to the system and edit the added policies. The app allows you to report car damage with appropriate photo documentation, from your insurance or the guilty partyâ€™s insurance. Additionally, the web application contains mechanisms enabling the detection of car damages on attached accident photos. After reporting the damage, the user can generate a pdf document summarizing the entire accident with the most important information about the accident and the damage detection information.

Build with client-server architecture:

- Server - ASP.NET Core
- Gui - React
- Mechanism of car damage detection - Azure Cognitive Services
